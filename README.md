# Elementary Classifiers
This repository has a quite simple, but yet extendable, implementation of KNN and Nearest Centroid Classifiers, with Hold-Out and Leave-One-Out validations.

You will find all the documentation inside the code. Checkout the `main.m` file to understand how to work with the classifiers and validation classes. For your testing purposes, a database `iris_log.dat` is already given.
